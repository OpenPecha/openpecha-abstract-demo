# note that there can be more complexity sometimes:
# - one volume having multiple sections with each their own pagination
# - different paginations on the same page
# see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XdKp6j860PhsYqpc1GVIetOPjJufEb7d6hHzr2ed6Pk/edit#
# the format should probably be more similar to the one in the aforementionned specs, exemplified on
# https://github.com/buda-base/manifest-tk
