general purpose, high-level code, Python is a favourite of up and coming coders. It was designed to be fun to use (after all, it’s named for Monty Python, how could it not be?) It’s another highly recommended language for coding beginners to learn – and has become the top introductory coding language in American university programs. It’s used mostly for web apps and information security, though it’s also popular in the academic community for data analysis. It’s used by tech giants like Google, Dropbox, Pinterest and Spotify.
