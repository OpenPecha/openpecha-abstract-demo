Almost everything said for Java also applies for C++, just more so: where Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter than 
equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent C++ code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python 
programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year. Python shines as a glue language, used 
to combine components written in C++.
