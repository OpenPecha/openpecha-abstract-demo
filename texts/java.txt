Java is currently the most popular and widely used language in the world. Though it was originally created for interactive TV, it’s become known as the language of choice for Android devices. It’s also the coding language of choice enterprise-level software. It’s a good multi-purpose coding language because it can be used cross-platform (meaning it’s just as easily used on smartphone apps as on desktop apps). It resembles C++ in syntax and structure making it easy to pick up if you know C languages already.
