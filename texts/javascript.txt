Python's "object-based" subset is roughly equivalent to JavaScript. Like JavaScript (and unlike Java), Python supports a 
programming style that uses simple functions and variables without engaging in class definitions. However, for JavaScript, 
that's all there is. Python, on the other hand, supports writing much larger programs and better code reuse through a true 
object-oriented programming style, where classes and inheritance play an important role.
